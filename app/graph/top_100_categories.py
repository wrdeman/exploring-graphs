    between pages in that category. So we get the pages within a category
    and sum the connections that occur between the pages in the category
    and exlude inter-category pages.

    First we create a lookup for graph nodes (pages) that contains a list of
    the pages link to/from it. Then we get the category and the pages within
    it and for each page it count the links to/from excluding the pages out
    of that category

    The count is the intersection (&) of all_links_for_all_pages and pages.
    Note by getting the difference (-) we can get the connectivity of the
    category.
